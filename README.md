These userscripts will monitor various sites for Playstation 5 availability. They should run fine with Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey or Violentmonkey under Firefox, Chrome, or Edge.

They haven't been tested all that well so I make no guarantees about how reliable they'll be.

For optimal performance, create a new browser profile with only the userscript extension installed. Here's how to do it in [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiple_profiles) and [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824).

### Installation

1. Install the scripts for your stores of choice.
2. Log in to each store.
3. Open the tab with the URL in the comments at the top of each each script. Be sure to leave it open.
4. To change the time between page reloads, edit the `refreshDelay` variable in each script. Lower numbers can really slow down your machine. I lower the number for a specific site only if I'm expecting stock to appear soon.
